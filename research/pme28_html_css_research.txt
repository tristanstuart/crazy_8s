HTML and CSS Research

This research is being done to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS. I have looked at files from this language
before, but needed to do research on formatting standards and other features to ensure I could appropriately
contribute to this project.

This research will directly increase the quality of the portions of the front-end that I contribute to on this project.
This includes the AboutMe page in sprint one, and any subsequent files in sprints two and three.

For the first sprint, I expect to apply this research in writing the HTML and CSS for the AboutMe page of our
website. In further sprints I expect to apply this information in other web elements.

The specific task that I have to do for this sprint which is dependent on my research is the 'Create About Us HTML
page' task.
