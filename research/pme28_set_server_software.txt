This document is here to detail the work done for task FC8-30 (Setup server software). This task entailed getting the OS and necessary dependencies setup to have an environment which can run the project. A local version of our repo was also cloned into the environment and run.

The project is run with the command 'flask run --host=0.0.0.0' to ensure the application is listening across all local network IPs. Additionally I setup port forwarding for port 5000 on my router and pointed it at the Raspberry Pi to send out of network traffic to our application. The result is that our application is accessible from anywhere, however due to security concerns, this environment is not yet the best way to run our application. For this reason we will only have it open for a moment or two during the demo.
