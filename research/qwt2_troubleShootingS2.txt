Crazy 8's Trouble Shooting Sprint 2

-Login page seems to not be functioning properly. When accessing the login page through
the nave bar I was unable to get the page to load. I believe that it used to load.

-Sign up page also does the same thing that the login page does. I believe that in earlier 
commits it was there but not functioning.

-Game logic seems to be working well. When playing a game by one's self they can draw 
all 51 cards, excluding the one that we are using for the face up card.

-When playing solo the user does not have to wait for anyone to finish their turn because 
there is no one else to take the turn so that logic is sound.

-Overall I tested all the buttons and features that we have implemented thus far and all 
seem to be working as intended.

Things We Could Add to Make our Page Better

-We could add some optional stock background music that can be disabled in the settings if 
the user wishes to do so.

-We could refactor our homepage to be more inviting and fun.

-Once the database is fully functional we can add avatars that the users can choose from.
