HTML/CSS Research

HTML:
HTML is the most widely used language for developing web pages.
It defines the structure of websites and formats web pages.
Web Architecture:
Website
Your browser starts by loading the main HTML file, and then the CSS and JavaScript
Userinteracts with the website and is not concerned with the backends of a web application
Web server
Once you've developed your website, you need to host it on a server
 to make it accessible on the internet
Server, along with the database contains all the data of a website and facilitates user interaction
IP Address
Website is hosted on an IP address
We put a domain name over that IP address, the same way we put names over peopleâ€™s phone numbers

CSS:
Css is not a programming language, it's in fact a styling language
Css is often used for presentation
Typically is attached to HTML elements in order to style the HTML
Css is creatively focused and is geared towards allowing you to do what you want in terms of styling existing content.
You can use multiple selectors to specify an ancestor of an element

Syntax:

selector{
	property1: value;
	property2 value;
}

Example:

h1{
	color: blue;
}

CSS Selectors:
Element - Elements like in the previous examples turn all of the h1 blue
Class - Lets you select HTML elements based upon its class
ID - Like an HTML attribute but the element can only have ID but can have multiple classes
Should be unique across the HTML but is not enforced
CSS Selector Combinations:
.selector-1.selector-2 {
	property: value;
}


JavaScript:
Allows fo us to have functional dynamic websites
JavaScript can be implemented in the frontend and backend of a website inorder to make the website capable of the dynamic requests called for it.
Can be used for mobile apps
