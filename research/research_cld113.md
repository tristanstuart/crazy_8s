# Christian Davis - Game Implementation Research  #

**Purpose of Research (Why you are doing it)**

* I need to understand how to implement a multiplayer web based game. 
* I do not know how to play crazy 8's

**What you expect to learn/do. Be specific by identifying what code/modules will be affected by the research/training**

* Learn how to implement game play on a web based app.
* Learn how to play the game.

**What do you expect to do with it, including any code you expect to write.  Be specific.  For example, "Writing the UI" is not sufficient.   "Writing the Login class" is.**

* write the game play class.
* write function to connect the front and backends

**What task(s) in Jira represent the work you will do that was/is dependent on the research/training.**

* Designing game room
