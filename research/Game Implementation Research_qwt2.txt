Sockets:
- Sockets are used nearly everywhere, but are one of the most severely misunderstood technologies around. 
- INET sockets account for 99% od sockets in use
- Client sockets are normally only used for one exchange
- A web server is a bit more complex. First, the web server creates a server socket


IPC:
- If you need fast IPC between two processes on one machine, look into pipes or shared memory
- If you need to use AF_INET sockets, bind the 'server' socket to 'localhost'. On most platforms 
this will take a shortcut around a couple of layers of network code and its quite a bit faster.

Using a Socket:
- The first thing to note, is that the web browser's "client" socket and the web server's 
"client" sockets are identical beasts
	- This is a "peer to peer" conversation.
- Normally, the connecting sockets starts the conversation, by sending in a request, or perhaps
a signon.
- The major stumbling block of sockets are the send and receive operations
- Send and receive operate on network buffers and do not necessarily handle all the bytes you 
hand them, because of their major focus is handling network buffers.
